Multiple Disease Prediction WebApp

This web application allows users to predict the likelihood of four different diseases (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's, and Breast Cancer) using machine learning models. Each model is implemented using scikit-learn and saved using pickle for later use.

Key Features:

Streamlit framework for user interface with clear navigation using an option menu.
Individual prediction pages for each disease with user input forms for relevant features.
Integration of trained models (SVM, Logistic Regression) for disease prediction.
Standardized data preprocessing with StandardScaler for consistency.
Display of clear prediction results for each disease.

Technologies Used:

Streamlit
scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM)
pandas
numpy
pickle
